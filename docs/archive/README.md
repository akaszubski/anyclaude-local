## 🗑️ When to Archive

Documents are moved here when they:

1. Describe completed work (no longer in progress)
2. Are superseded by newer documentation
3. Contain historical context but not current instructions
4. Would clutter the main docs/ directory

## ✅ When to Keep in Main Docs

Keep documents in main docs/ directories when they:

1. Contain current, actionable information
2. Are actively maintained
3. Serve as reference for ongoing work
4. Are user-facing (guides, tutorials, etc.)
